Snd: Send. Specify the presence or absence of hot key transmission.
     0->No  1->Yes


Key: Specify which hot key to send.
     0->Split  1->Pause  2->Resume

Thr.: Specify threshold of image matching [0 - 100]. The higher the value, the more severe the judgment.
      When the coincidence rate of the image exceeds this value, it is judged that they match.

Sleep: After matching, specify the time to start looking for the next image.
       If the next image recognition is set to be long enough not to hinder the image recognition, the risk of false recognition will be reduced.


T: Timing. Specify the timing of hot key transmission.

  0: Send immediately                                                                                                  
  1: Send after waiting "Delay"
  2: The range specified by PX/PY/SX/SY(D) is darkened+ after waiting "Delay"
  3: After matching, the image is transmitted after disappearance from the screen + after waiting "Delay" (by template matching)
  4: After matching, the image is transmitted after disappearance from the screen + after waiting "Delay" (by color matching)

 *For 3 and 4, basically it is OK if you use 3.
 *If both before and after matching are monochrome, 3 can not be used, so please use 4.

Delay: Specify the time to send a hot key after matching (ms).

C.Al.: Color Allowance [0-128]. Specify the threshold of darkness(T=2 only). If the dark screen is not perfect black, increase this value.

Seek: Specify seek time of movie after image matching. (s). Not set with "-1"

Other: I explain with Manual with images.
